                                <p>I am a technology enthusiast with experience in the Information Technology field. I recently graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. During my time at Clemson I worked in the College of Business as an IT Support Assistant. I currently maintain my own website running on Azure Web Apps and each is hosted in a separate on Azure Web App container. I also built and maintain my own personal home server. These experiences have given me experience in Linux Administration, web development, networking and cloud infrastructure.</p>

                                <p>I was also part of a team who created a VR animation program in Unity3D.</p>

                                <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing strategy games and improving my home network performance. I am also very frugal and have a side interest in economics. I am always looking for ways to reduce costs and invest in the future.</p>

                            <h2> Latest Updates </h2>
                            <p> In a continued effort to reduce cost I have decided to shut down the AWS EC2 instance this website & projects were previously hosted on and migrated to Azure's Web Apps service. Each project runs in their own App container and the main sites static elements also have their own container. Some static projects which are completed and unlikely to changed often are actually still hosted on S3 though.
                            </p>

                            <p> I also took this migration process as an opportunity to set up some basic CI through Gitlab's CI tools, so no more manually pulling updates. Overall I'm pretty happy with my setup now, all for the low price of $0 per month (usually).</p>
