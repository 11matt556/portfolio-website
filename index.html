                            <p>I am a technology enthusiast with experience in the Information Technology field. I recently graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. 
                                During my time at Clemson I worked in the College of Business as an IT Support Assistant. I currently maintain my own website running on Azure Web Apps and each is hosted in a 
                                separate on Azure Web App container. I also built and maintain my own personal home server. These experiences have given me experience in Linux Administration, web development, networking and cloud infrastructure.</p>

                                <p>I was also part of a team who created a VR animation program in Unity3D.</p>

                                <p>In my spare time I enjoy playing strategy games and improving my home network performance. I am also very frugal and have a side interest in economics. I am always looking for ways to reduce costs and invest in the future.</p>
